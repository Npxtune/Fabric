# Fabric
Fabric Game Engine (WIP)

## General
This Engine is written in Rust and uses various other crates.
Graphics: [glium] (https://github.com/glium/glium) (OpenGL Rust wrapper)
Audio: [rodio] (https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio)

**There are currently 5 demos:**
1.  cube
2.  moving cube
3.  rotating cube
4.  3d teapot
5.  audio playback

The rendering demos were created by following this [tutorial](https://github.com/glium/glium/blob/master/book/),
and have been modified by me (Triangle -> Cube).

To play an audio file, please instert a file by the name "sound.mp3" into "./assets".
(Audio implemented through external library, -> performance problems CPU)
